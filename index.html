          <h2>About Me</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          My name is <b>Jakub</b>, also known as <b>DirtyFaced</b> in the gaming world or <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198823728506/" title="My Steam profile page">Laudethaire de Sanglac on Steam</a>. I’m a passionate and experienced mod-maker who spent last four years working on mods for game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/261550/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord/" title="Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord's Steam page">Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord</a>. While my background isn’t professional yet, my practical experience and deep understanding of game mechanics drive my goal of breaking into the game development industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main project consists of three mods used by the largest Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord multiplayer community known as <a href="https://bretonnia.org/" title="Kingdom of Bretonnia's community website (not made by me)">Kingdom of Bretonnia or BRE</a> on their regularly hosted 500 player battle events <i>(links to their steam-workshop pages below)</i>. These mods contain new playable units, weapons, maps, game mechanics and admin tools making organisation and administration of these large-scale events possible.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>BRE Core <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3355093813" title="BRE Core mod's Steam Workshop page">(Steam Workshop)</a> <a href="https://github.com/BRE-Devlopment/BRE_Core" title="BRE Core mod's GitHub repository">(GitHub repository)</a> - The core mod containing most of our custom assets and scripts. It is used together with either of the other two.</li>

          In the Bannerlord modding scene I also:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Was commissioned by a popular mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/7750" title="Burning Empires mod's page on Nexus mods">Burning Empires</a> to add new factions, base-game tweaks and finding and dealing with bugs.</li>
          <li>Was commissioned by a famous Czech streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/robdiesalot?lang=sk" title="RobDiesALot's Twitch profile page">RobDiesALot</a> to create a mod used for their own hosted game events.</li>
          <li>Worked on a large multiplayer persistant survival-styled mod. Sadly this mod never got fully finished due to shortage of free time aswell as a similar mod being released by a different modder. However the project had several completely custom features finished such as resource gathering, inventory management and item crafting. <a href="https://github.com/DirtyFaced/BRE_Persistant" title="Persistant mod's Github repository">(GitHub repository)</a></li>
          <li>Had the opportunity to work together with professional game artists.</li>
          <li>Helped few other multiplayer modders with creation of their own mods.</li>

          Disclaimer
        </h3>
        <p class="image-desc">
          While I am, and for most of the time have been, the lead developer of the previously mentioned mods, they are all group projects. Most of the mod assets — such as 3D models, textures, maps (scenes), and animations — are created by different members of our team. My personal focus within these projects is the implementation of these assets: importing them into the game’s modding kit, configuring correct material settings, animation clip settings, cloth physics, and similar systems. In addition, I handle bug investigation and fixing, modification of base game features, and scripting of new ones.
        </p>
        <p class="image-desc">
          The game provides only very limited documentation of its internal infrastructure and modding tools, which makes this work a significant challenge on its own. While I cannot create these assets entirely from scratch by myself, I do have the experience and knowledge to fix smaller issues directly at the asset-source level — for example, adding missing LODs to models or correcting minor weight-painting or UV issues.

          Game mechanics
        </h3>
        <p>
          Using C# I developed and implemented a wide range of custom game mechanics — some of which are showcased below. In addition, I worked extensively with XML, using XSD to define and validate game object schemas and XSLT to transform and manage game object data efficiently.
